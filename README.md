   # customer.py -->
The customer.py file defines the Customer class, which manages customer details. It ensures that a customer's name is a string between 1 and 15 characters. The class includes methods to get and set the customer’s name and provides a readable string representation of the instance.


   # coffee.py -->
The coffee.py file contains the Coffee class, which represents coffee options. It validates that each coffee’s name is a string with at least 3 characters and tracks all coffee instances. The class provides a method to display a formatted menu of available coffees and their prices.


   # order.py -->
The order.py file defines the Order class, managing orders with a customer, a coffee, and a price. It ensures proper types and values for these attributes and maintains a list of all orders. The class includes a method to represent each order as a string.


  # MAIN.py -->
The main.py file is the main script for the application. It sets up coffee options, allows users to place orders, view sales, and check inventory. It uses functions to handle customer input, display menus, and manage orders, providing a simple interface for interacting with the coffee shop system.


  # In Summary
The Coffee Shop application consists of four main components. customer.py defines the Customer class, which manages and validates customer names. coffee.py contains the Coffee class, responsible for creating and validating coffee options, and displaying a menu of available coffees. order.py introduces the Order class, which handles and validates orders by associating customers, coffees, and prices, while tracking all orders placed. main.py is the entry point for the application, handling user interactions such as setting up coffee options, placing orders, viewing sales, and checking coffee inventory through various functions.


# Run the application: 
Execute the main.py script using Python3. In your terminal
